 * @note It is recommended that the initial Ex10Reader.init_ex10() function
 *       sets the Impinj Reader Chip into a state consistent with
 *       ``PowerModeReady``.
 *       - This is consistent with how the Ex10Reader.init_ex10() initializes
 *         the Impinj Reader Chip.
 *       - This is consistent with the
 *         Ex10BoardSpec.get_default_gpio_output_levels() implementation.
 *       - This will not conflict with stored settings startup sequencing.
 *       - It is expected that since the Impinj Reader Chip is being powered
 *         up then there are tags to be inventoried; PowerModeReady is ready
 *         to start inventorying tags.
 *       - If the Ex10Reader module is changed to complete its initialization,
 *         via the Ex10Reader.init_ex10() function, into a mode other than
 *         PowerModeReady, then the Ex10PowerModes.init() behavior will need
 *         to change accordingly.
