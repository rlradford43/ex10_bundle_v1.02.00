/**
 * @struct HostInterface
 * The Ex10 host interface is a serial device master which controls the Ex10.
 *
 * Ex10 supports the following protocol:
 * SPI
 *   CPOL = 0 (clock idles low)
 *   CPHA = 1 (data launches on rising edge and is captured on falling edge)
 *   Clock Rates:
 *     4 MHz maximum clock rate when controlling the Application.
 *     1 MHz maximum clock rate when controlling the Bootloader.
 *   Notes:
 *   - When sending data to the Ex10, using the write() method, the received
 *     data on the MISO line contains no valid information.
 *   - When receiving data from the Ex10, using the read() method, the data
 *     sent on the MOSI line is ignored by the Ex10.
